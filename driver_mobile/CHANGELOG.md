## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Vehicle Overview Screen**: Created the responsive, pixel-perfect [VehicleOverviewScreen](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/vehicle_overview_screen.dart) for the Driver Module featuring:
  - Dark Navy (`#101C2C`) App Bar with back navigation, white icons/typography, and company logo.
  - Reusable [VehicleInfoCard](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/widgets/vehicle_overview/vehicle_info_card.dart) displaying white delivery van banner (`white_van.png`), green `"Active"` badge, vehicle code (`BT-990`), registration details (`Medium Van • ABC-1234`), right-aligned orange Fuel Type (`Diesel`), and 3 metric cards (Fuel Level: 82%, Health: 94%, Status: OK).
  - Reusable [VehicleActionTile](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/widgets/vehicle_overview/vehicle_action_tile.dart) with dark navy square icon container, bold title, optional red critical indicator, and right chevron arrow.
  - Complete list of 10 vehicle action items: Vehicle Details, Vehicle Status, Maintenance Alerts (*1 CRITICAL*), Insurance Details, Registration Certificate (RC), Pollution Certificate (PUC), Fitness Certificate, Vehicle Documents, Assigned Trips, and Report Vehicle Issue.
- **Dashboard Navigation Integration**: Linked [DashboardScreen](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart) "View Details" button to push [VehicleOverviewScreen](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/vehicle_overview_screen.dart).
- **Vehicle Overview Widget Tests**: Extended [widget_test.dart](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/test/widget_test.dart) covering vehicle info card details, metrics, and action list rendering.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **AppColors Ambiguous Import & Theme Resolution**: Resolved duplicate import error in [app_theme.dart](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/theme/app_theme.dart) by consolidating `AppColors` definition in [constants/app_colors.dart](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/constants/app_colors.dart), adding color aliases (`textPrimary`, `textSecondary`, `textDisabled`), and re-exporting from [theme/app_colors.dart](file:///c:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/theme/app_colors.dart).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Reset Password Screen**: Created the responsive, pixel-perfect [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart) featuring:
  - New Password and Confirm Password inputs with visibility toggles.
  - Interactive password requirements box (8+ characters, one number, one special character) updating dynamically in real-time.
  - Match validation to ensure both password entries are identical.
- **OTP-to-Reset Navigation**: Linked [OTPScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/otp_screen.dart) "Verify OTP" button to push [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart).
- **Forgot Password Reset Link**: Linked the "Reset Password?" action text link on [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart) to push navigation to [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart).
- **End-to-End Authentication Widget Test**: Extended [widget_test.dart](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/test/widget_test.dart) to cover the entire auth path (Login -> Forgot -> OTP -> Reset -> Return to Login).

### Fixed
- **Verify OTP Button State & Navigation**: Refactored the "Verify OTP" button on [OTPScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/otp_screen.dart) to be always active. Clicking the button now triggers a validation alert SnackBar if the 6 digit code is incomplete, ensuring navigation to [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart) executes reliably without focus sync edge-cases on web targets.
- **Forgot Password Button Layout & Navigation**: Fixed layout constraints on [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart) by setting Column crossAxisAlignment to stretch and wrapping button Row in a FittedBox, resolving the RenderFlex horizontal overflow exception on Chrome. Added listener to confirm password field in [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart) to rebuild and update button active state in real-time, resolving navigation block.
- **Card Layout Normalization & Constraints**: Enforced uniform `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch` constraints across the form card container columns of [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart), [OTPScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/otp_screen.dart), and [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart). Centered header, logo, and footer elements explicitly inside `Center` widgets. This guarantees there are no horizontal RenderFlex layout overflow errors or navigation-blocking rendering failures across any web or desktop viewport dimensions.
- **Reset Password Navigation Stack Fix**: Upgraded the "Reset Password" button click and "Back to Login" link handlers in [ResetPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart) to use `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil` instead of `popUntil`. This guarantees navigation back to [LoginScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart) works flawlessly, even if the user performs a hot-reload directly on the reset password screen (which empties the navigation stack history).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **OTP Verification Screen**: Created the responsive, pixel-perfect [OTPScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/otp_screen.dart) featuring:
  - 6 individual code fields with automatic focus forwarding and backspace focus redirection.
  - A 30-second countdown timer.
  - A "Resend" button active only after the timer expires.
  - Field validation to ensure all 6 digits are entered before verification.
- **Forgot-to-OTP Navigation**: Integrated navigation flow from [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart) to [OTPScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/otp_screen.dart).
- **Comprehensive Smoke Test Suite**: Upgraded [widget_test.dart](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/test/widget_test.dart) to verify the entire authentication navigation flow (Login -> Forgot Password -> OTP Verification).

### Changed
- **Forgot Password Layout Refactoring**: Restructured [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart) to place all elements (logo, headers, inputs, buttons, and footers) inside the card container to match the design style of the OTP Verification screen.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Forgot Password Screen**: Created the responsive, pixel-perfect [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart) supporting email/mobile entry, validation, "Reset Password?" action link, and a "Send OTP" action button.
- **Login-to-Forgot Navigation**: Integrated navigation flow between [LoginScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart) and [ForgotPasswordScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart).
- **Navigation Widget Tests**: Enhanced [widget_test.dart](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/test/widget_test.dart) to test the complete user navigation journey between both authentication screens.
- **Project Rule Configuration**: Established the project rule file [AGENTS.md](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/.agents/AGENTS.md) to dynamically enforce synchronization of codebase changes and documentation files.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Centralized Design System**: Added Material 3 theme configuration with custom colors and fonts in [app_colors.dart](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/theme/app_colors.dart) and [app_theme.dart](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/theme/app_theme.dart).
- **Poppins & Nunito Fonts**: Integrated `google_fonts` package in [pubspec.yaml](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/pubspec.yaml) to supply typography requirements without bundling raw `.ttf` assets.
- **Pixel-Perfect Login Screen**: Designed and created the responsive, Material 3 compliant [LoginScreen](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart) supporting:
  - Scrollable viewports to prevent keyboard overlaps.
  - Custom styled input fields with outline borders and prefix icons.
  - Visibility toggles for the password field.
  - Custom Google Sign-In button with auto-scaling to prevent overflows.
  - Legal disclaimer footer using rich text formatting.
- **Local Asset Integration**: Configured local assets directory and registered [logo.png](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/assets/images/logo.png) (copied from frontend public directory) and [google_logo.png](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/assets/images/google_logo.png) in [pubspec.yaml](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/pubspec.yaml) to circumvent cross-origin (CORS) network errors on web target.
- **Smoke Tests**: Added and configured widget tests in [widget_test.dart](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/Fleet-management-system/driver_mobile/test/widget_test.dart) verifying login screen layout, text fields, controller values, and action buttons.
